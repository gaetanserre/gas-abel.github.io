        Hello team !! I am Gaspard Abel, a student at the University of Cambridge. I am currently studying for a PhD in Computer Science. I am interested in the intersection between machine learning and computer vision. I am also a teaching assistant for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at the University of Cambridge. I am looking forward to meeting you all and working together on this project.
